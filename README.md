### TODO ###

 * main resource that translates short urls to a 302 redirect (DONE)
 * short resource serves up index.html (DONE)
 * tweak css so we see the full path in the UI. (DONE)
 * port to use postgres database (*)
 * add goto button on UI to see we get 302 redirect.
 * write out long form blog post as Markdown

 Nice to have:
 * fault tolerance for event handler, how should it's supervisor look, what
   happens when something errors out?
 * generate shorter unique links
 * gen_event calls to tally statistics on how many urls get visited, etc
 * clean up javascript to provide a copy to paste bin implementation
 * deploy to heroku
 * check whether link already exists and return correct code
 * add support for viewing events generated by the server

## Resources

   link and provides a 302 redirect to the correct location
 * erlio_link_resource   -  gets links from the application
 * erlio_links_resource  - creates links from the application
